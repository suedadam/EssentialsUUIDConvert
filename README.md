EssentialsUUIDConvert
=============

A simple tool to convert Essentials files to support UUIDs 

I don't care for this project much, literally took me under 10 minutes to make and I only made it because I was bored and needed to get over some stress, the main goal was to beat a friend's version of this which was made in Java, mission accomplished
